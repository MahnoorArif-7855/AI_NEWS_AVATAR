    "summary": "Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a joint press conference condemning Russia's recent massive missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, which broke the terms of a temporary energy ceasefire. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for consequences for Russia and stronger defense capabilities for Europe, while agreeing with Rutte that an 800,000-strong Ukrainian army is acceptable, contrasting with Russia’s demand for a 600,000 cap. Rutte called for binding security guarantees for Ukraine, highlighted ongoing military support through the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), and urged better burden-sharing among Nato allies. Despite Russia’s continued aggression causing civilian suffering and infrastructure damage, both leaders expressed willingness to negotiate a peaceful deal, though recent attacks cast doubt on Moscow’s intentions.",

    "summary": "Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of violating a temporary ceasefire agreement brokered by Donald Trump to halt attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure during the coldest part of winter.

The attacks coincided with upcoming peace talks in Abu Dhabi, where Ukraine and its allies are prepared to enforce a ceasefire through a multi-tiered plan involving diplomatic and potentially military responses to any violations. NATO and Western leaders condemned the strikes as an escalation aimed at terrorizing civilians, emphasizing the need for increased support to Ukraine’s air defense capabilities.",
