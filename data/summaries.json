    "summary": "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a joint press conference addressing recent Russian attacks on Ukraine, which included a record number of ballistic missiles targeting energy infrastructure and causing widespread outages in harsh winter conditions. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for consequences against Russia for violating a temporary energy ceasefire, called for expanded European missile defense capabilities, and stated that an 800,000-strong Ukrainian army is acceptable for security, contrasting with Russia's demand for a 600,000 cap. Rutte highlighted NATO's commitment to providing binding security guarantees and military aid—including $15 billion in weapons through the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List—while condemning Russia's full-scale invasion as chaotic and targeting civilians. Despite ongoing difficulties, both leaders expressed openness to negotiations, although recent Russian strikes were seen as a negative signal ahead of upcoming trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi.",
