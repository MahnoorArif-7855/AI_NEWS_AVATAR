    "text": "From 9h ago 15.05 GMT Ukraine 'ready to play ball' and come to an acceptable deal but Russia 'creating chaos' with its attacks, Nato chief says Nato secretary general Mark Rutte and Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a joint press conference earlier and both gave statements to the press before taking questions. Here are the highlights: Volodymyr Zelenskyy Zelenskyy said there must be “ consequences ” for Russia’s overnight attack on Ukraine, which he said broke the terms of the temporary energy ceasefire announced by the US last week. He cautioned against “partners” remaining “silent” over the strikes.\n\nZelenskyy said licenses are needed so Europe can adequately protect itself, including for missiles crucial for air defence systems that the US has. Zelenskyy said himself and Rutte agreed that a Ukrainian army with 800,000 personnel is an acceptable size. As a reminder, the Kremlin has said it will only feel safe when Ukraine’s army is capped at 600,000. Zelenskyy said EU membership forms a key part of security guarantees but said the most important thing is what “Europeans would be ready to do if Russia will attack us again and what Americans will do”. Mark Rutte Rutte said Ukraine needs binding commitments and security guarantees in the case of future Russian aggression. He said this is what the ‘coalition of the willing’ brings, including the deployment of European forces and a “crucial” US “ backstop ”.\n\nRutte said he is confident that allies would allocate $15bn this year under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) programme , under which Nato countries buy weapons from the US to give to Ukraine. He said two-thirds of Nato allies are participating in the initiative.\n\nRutte also urged for more equal “burden-sharing” as some allies “are doing a lot” and a few are “doing nothing”. He stressed the positive contributions of countries including Norway, Holland, Germany, Denmark, Canada and Sweden. Rutte said Russia’s full-scale invasion, launched in February 2022, was “crazy” and said its continuing assault on Ukraine is targeting civilian infrastructure, creating “ chaos ” for innocent civilians.\n\nRutte said Ukraine is ready “to play ball” and come to a deal – acceptable to Kyiv – with the Russian side, but added that the massive Russian attack last night was a “really bad signal” ahead of future negotiations.

Zelenskyy said there were 32 ballistic missiles, 28 cruise missiles, 11 missiles of “other types” and 450 attack drones used in the assualt that was launched as temperatures dropped to -20C and left many apartments in Kyiv without heating.\n\nNato secretary-general Mark Rutte visited Kyiv in a show of support.

Sweden will fund 2.1 billion crowns of the purchase of Tridon air defence systems, developed by BAE Systems Bofors, the Swedish arm of the defence material group, while Denmark will contribute about 500 million crowns, Swedish defence minister Pal Jonson said. “This means that Ukraine can develop an air defence battalion if they so wish,” he told a joint press conference in Gothenburg, Sweden, with his Danish counterpart Troels Lund Poulsen. “The purchase doesn’t just support Ukraine on the battlefield with more material, but also strengthens our production capacity in Sweden.“ Share\n\n11h ago 12.49 GMT Russia 'paying heavy price' for the war, with over 'one million casualties to date and rising' - Nato chief According to a summary of the address, Mark Rutte also said: President Trump and his team are determined to stop the bloodshed, with the support of America’s allies – and it is clear that Ukraine is committed. Direct talks are now underway and this is important progress. But Russian attacks like those last night, do not signal seriousness about peace. We know Russia is paying a heavy price for this war with over one million casualties to date and rising. Yet, despite Putin’s willingness to sacrifice countless of his own people, he’s not winning. Any gains on the battlefield are grindingly slow. Share\n\n11h ago 12.47 GMT Nato chief says securing Russia-Ukraine agreement 'will require difficult choices' During Nato chief Mark Rutte’s address to the Ukrainian parliament earlier, he said: The United States, Europe and Canada have affirmed their readiness to provide the assurance that Ukraine needs to be able to forge a peace with Russia. The members of the coalition of the willing made encouraging progress on these guarantees when they met last month in Paris. I was at that meeting and so was President Zelenskyy. Some European allies have announced that they will deploy troops to Ukraine after a deal is reached. Troops on the ground, jets in the air, ships on the Black Sea. The United States will be the backstop, others have vowed to support in other ways. The security guarantees are solid, and this is crucial – because we know that getting to an agreement to end this terrible war will require difficult choices. Share\n\n11h ago 12.27 GMT Zelenskyy says work of his negotiators 'will be adjusted' after Russia used 'record number' of ballistic missiles in latest attack Shifting our attention back to Ukraine now, where the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Russia’s latest attacks involved a “record number” of ballistic missiles and deliberately targeted energy infrastructure. Zelenskyy said there were 32 ballistic missiles, 28 cruise missiles, 11 missiles of “other types” and 450 attack drones used in the assualt that was launched as temperatures dropped to -20C and left many apartments in Kyiv without heating. In a post on X, Zelenskyy wrote: Energy infrastructure facilities in several regions were hit, with the greatest damage in the Kharkiv and Dnipro regions, Kyiv and the region, the Vinnytsia and Odesa regions, as well as in Zaporizhzhia… The heating situation is particularly difficult in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro, as well as Lozova in the Kharkiv region … Each such Russian strike confirms that attitudes in Moscow have not changed: they continue to bet on war and the destruction of Ukraine, and they do not take diplomacy seriously. The work of our negotiating team will be adjusted accordingly. The overnight Russian ballistic and drone attack came shortly before Nato chief Mark Rutte was in Kyiv to meet Zelenskyy and to address the national parliament. The latest round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US are due to be held on Wednesday and Thursday in Abu Dhabi. You can read more here.

    "title": "Zelenskyy accuses Russia of violating Trump-brokered truce amid cold snap",
    "text": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia on Tuesday of violating an agreement with Donald Trump to hold off from attacking Ukraine’s energy systems in the depths of a freezing winter, as its forces carried out large-scale airstrikes on Kyiv on the eve of three-way talks in Abu Dhabi.\n\nUkraine’s president said Moscow carried out a massive and “deliberate” attack overnight as temperatures in Kyiv plunged to -20C. It involved a record number of 71 ballistic missiles as well as 450 drones, he said, sent to destroy energy infrastructure.\n\nMore than 1,000 residential buildings in Kyiv were without heating on Tuesday.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia had broken a promise that Trump had last week framed as a personal request to Vladimir Putin to stop hitting Kyiv and “various towns” for a week because of the exceptionally cold weather. “He agreed to do that. And I have to tell you it was very nice,” the US president said on Thursday.\n\nThe Kremlin later announced the truce would last only until Sunday. According to Ukraine, the ceasefire should have continued until this Friday.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia had used this brief pause in fighting to stockpile weapons. “Either Russia now believes that there are four incomplete days in a week instead of seven, or they are really betting only on war and waiting for the coldest days of this winter,” he said.\n\n“We believe this Russian strike clearly violates what the American side discussed, and there must be consequences.”\n\nTrump told reporters that Putin had made an agreement that expired on Sunday. “It was Sunday to Sunday, and it opened up and he hit them hard last night,” he said at the White House. “He kept his word on that … we’ll take anything, because it’s really, really cold over there. But it was on Sunday, and he went from Sunday to Sunday.“\n\nAsked if he was disappointed, Trump replied: “I want him to end the war.”\n\nA second round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US to end the war are due to take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Abu Dhabi. A first round last month failed to yield a breakthrough.\n\nVisiting Kyiv, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Tuesday accused Moscow of trying to “create chaos for innocent civilians”. Zelenskyy was “absolutely ready to play ball” in talks this week, he said, questioning whether the Russians “are serious”. He called the overnight attack a “really bad signal”.\n\nRutte praised Trump as the only person capable of brokering a peaceful solution, almost four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion. “Be assured that Nato stands with Ukraine and is ready to do so for years to come. Your security is our security. Your peace is our peace,” he told Zelenskyy.\n\nKyiv residents reported loud explosions beginning at 1am on Tuesday in strikes that caused damage to five Kyiv districts and injured at least nine people. An air raid alert stayed in effect for more than five hours.\n\n“Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorise people is more important to Russia than turning to diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said. He called on western partners to step up the supply of missiles for air defence systems in order to protect “normal life”.\n\nView image in fullscreen An apartment building hit by a Russian drone strike in Kyiv. Photograph: Valentyn Ogirenko/Reuters\n\n“Without pressure on Russia, this war will not end. Now Moscow is choosing terror and escalation, and that’s why maximum pressure is needed,” he wrote on social media.\n\nAmong the infrastructure hit overnight were facilities to heat water for distribution to Ukrainian homes.\n\n“Hundreds of thousands of families, including children, were deliberately left without heating during the harshest winter conditions, with temperatures dropping to -25C,” the Ukrainian energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on X.\n\nKyiv resident Natalia Hlobenko, 35, described how she rushed to cover her 11-year-old son on Tuesday before an explosion sprayed her apartment with broken glass. “Where is this ceasefire?” said a teary Hlobenko, bundled up in her windowless apartment.\n\nUkraine said the attack had damaged the Motherland monument, a Soviet-era second world war memorial. The 62-metre titanium statue of a woman holding a sword and a shield with a Ukrainian trident looms above the city and the Dnipro River, which has frozen over.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Motherland monument in Kyiv pictured in January. Photograph: Efrem Lukatsky/AP\n\n“It is both symbolic and cynical: the aggressor state strikes at a place of remembrance of the struggle against aggression in the 20th century, repeating its crimes in the 21st century,” the culture minister, Tetyana Berezhna, wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi talks take place amid reports that Ukraine has agreed a multi-tier plan with its allies for enforcing any ceasefire with Russia. The plan was discussed in December and January by Ukrainian, European and US officials.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, citing sources involved in the negotiations, a Russian violation of the truce would trigger a response within 24 hours. This would initially involve a diplomatic warning followed, if necessary, by Ukrainian army action to restore a ceasefire.\n\nIf hostilities continued after 72 hours, Ukraine and its allies would move to a second stage. It would involve a military response from the coalition of the willing, and include American forces.\n\nTuesday’s attacks took place across Ukraine. In Kyiv, 1,170 buildings were without power. In the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said energy infrastructure had been damaged. More than 800 buildings were without heat, as water was drained from radiator systems to stop them freezing in the bitter cold.\n\n“The goal is obvious: to cause maximum destruction and leave the city without heat in severe cold,” Terekhov wrote on Telegram. The deputy prime minister, Oleksii Kuleba, said 110,000 properties in Kharkiv had been left without heating after the attack.\n\nView image in fullscreen Workers installing anti-drone nets over a road in icy conditions near Kharkiv on Monday. Photograph: Vyacheslav Madiyevskyy/Reuters\n\nThe public broadcaster Suspilne said Russian strikes had knocked out electricity in two towns in the Kharkiv region, Izium and Balakliia, and struck two apartment buildings in the northern city of Sumy.\n\nRussian propagandists have been celebrating the Kremlin’s deliberate destruction of Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks – a war crime.\n\n“We have driven Ukraine into the stone age. Terrifying cold is approaching. The energy system is extremely sensitive to imbalance,” the presenter Vladimir Solovyov told state TV. He predicted Kyiv would become “a giant cesspool”.",
