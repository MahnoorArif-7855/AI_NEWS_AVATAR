    "text": "From 5h ago 15.05 GMT Ukraine 'ready to play ball' and come to an acceptable deal but Russia 'creating chaos' with its attacks, Nato chief says Nato secretary general Mark Rutte and Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a joint press conference earlier and both gave statements to the press before taking questions. Here are the highlights: Volodymyr Zelenskyy Zelenskyy said there must be “ consequences ” for Russia’s overnight attack on Ukraine, which he said broke the terms of the temporary energy ceasefire announced by the US last week. He cautioned against “partners” remaining “silent” over the strikes.\n\nZelenskyy said licenses are needed so Europe can adequately protect itself, including for missiles crucial for air defence systems that the US has. Zelenskyy said himself and Rutte agreed that a Ukrainian army with 800,000 personnel is an acceptable size. As a reminder, the Kremlin has said it will only feel safe when Ukraine’s army is capped at 600,000. Zelenskyy said EU membership forms a key part of security guarantees but said the most important thing is what “Europeans would be ready to do if Russia will attack us again and what Americans will do”. Mark Rutte Rutte said Ukraine needs binding commitments and security guarantees in the case of future Russian aggression. He said this is what the ‘coalition of the willing’ brings, including the deployment of European forces and a “crucial” US “ backstop ”.\n\nRutte said he is confident that allies would allocate $15bn this year under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) programme , under which Nato countries buy weapons from the US to give to Ukraine. He said two-thirds of Nato allies are participating in the initiative.\n\nRutte also urged for more equal “burden-sharing” as some allies “are doing a lot” and a few are “doing nothing”. He stressed the positive contributions of countries including Norway, Holland, Germany, Denmark, Canada and Sweden. Rutte said Russia’s full-scale invasion, launched in February 2022, was “crazy” and said its continuing assault on Ukraine is targeting civilian infrastructure, creating “ chaos ” for innocent civilians.\n\nRutte said Ukraine is ready “to play ball” and come to a deal – acceptable to Kyiv – with the Russian side, but added that the massive Russian attack last night was a “really bad signal” ahead of future negotiations.

The gigantic statue of a woman holding a sword and shield towers over the Ukrainian capital, with a complex at its base housing the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia’s latest attacks involved a “record number” of ballistic missiles and deliberately targeted energy infrastructure. Zelenskyy said there were 32 ballistic missiles, 28 cruise missiles, 11 missiles of “other types” and 450 attack drones used in the assualt that was launched as temperatures dropped to -20C and left many apartments in Kyiv without heating.\n\nNato secretary-general Mark Rutte visited Kyiv in a show of support. He said that the overnight strikes raise doubts about Moscow’s intentions on the eve of talks, calling them “a really bad signal.” He added that it was clear that the attacks only strengthen Ukrainians’ resolve.\n\nAn air alert warning of a possible Russian missile attack blared out across Kyiv on Tuesday during a visit by Nato chief Mark Rutte, AFP reporters heard. The Ukrainian air force warned there was a “threat of a ballistic” missile.\n\nSweden and Denmark will jointly procure and supply Ukraine with air defence systems worth 2.6 billion Swedish crowns ($290 million) to help it ward off Russian attacks, the countries’ defence ministers said on Tuesday. Sweden will fund 2.1 billion crowns of the purchase of Tridon air defence systems, developed by BAE Systems Bofors, the Swedish arm of the defence material group, while Denmark will contribute about 500 million crowns, Swedish defence minister Pal Jonson said.\n\nNato has started the military planning for an Arctic Sentry mission, a spokesperson for the alliance’s military headquarters Shape said on Tuesday. “Planning is underway for a Nato enhanced vigilance activity, named Arctic Sentry,” Colonel Martin L O’Donnell, spokesperson for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, said, confirming a report by German magazine Spiegel.\n\nThe European Commission would be “open-minded” to discussing closer trade ties with the UK, including a customs union, a senior EU official has said.

Europe is increasingly focused on “digital sovereignty” - the idea that reliance on companies from an increasingly isolationist United States is a threat to Europe’s economy and security.\n\nFrance is lacking in warships and accompanying missiles required to face an era that could lead to war, army chief Fabien Mandon said on Tuesday. “Today the number of warships is insufficient and the quantities of missiles on board [of ships] are especially insufficient,” Mandon told a naval conference in Paris.\n\nKyrgyzstan said on Tuesday the European Union’s sanctions envoy would visit on 26 February after a report that the EU was planning to ban some exports to the Central Asian country for allegedly facilitating Russian sanctions evasion. Bloomberg News reported last week that the EU was considering the first use of its “last resort” anti-sanctions evasion tool by banning exports of certain categories of goods to Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe son of Norway’s crown princess has pleaded not guilty to four counts of rape on the first day of his trial for multiple offences, a legal saga that has embarrassed the royal family and raised questions over domestic abuse in Norway.

Sweden will fund 2.1 billion crowns of the purchase of Tridon air defence systems, developed by BAE Systems Bofors, the Swedish arm of the defence material group, while Denmark will contribute about 500 million crowns, Swedish defence minister Pal Jonson said. “This means that Ukraine can develop an air defence battalion if they so wish,” he told a joint press conference in Gothenburg, Sweden, with his Danish counterpart Troels Lund Poulsen. “The purchase doesn’t just support Ukraine on the battlefield with more material, but also strengthens our production capacity in Sweden.“ Share\n\n8h ago 12.49 GMT Russia 'paying heavy price' for the war, with over 'one million casualties to date and rising' - Nato chief According to a summary of the address, Mark Rutte also said: President Trump and his team are determined to stop the bloodshed, with the support of America’s allies – and it is clear that Ukraine is committed. Direct talks are now underway and this is important progress. But Russian attacks like those last night, do not signal seriousness about peace. We know Russia is paying a heavy price for this war with over one million casualties to date and rising. Yet, despite Putin’s willingness to sacrifice countless of his own people, he’s not winning. Any gains on the battlefield are grindingly slow. Share\n\n8h ago 12.47 GMT Nato chief says securing Russia-Ukraine agreement 'will require difficult choices' During Nato chief Mark Rutte’s address to the Ukrainian parliament earlier, he said: The United States, Europe and Canada have affirmed their readiness to provide the assurance that Ukraine needs to be able to forge a peace with Russia. The members of the coalition of the willing made encouraging progress on these guarantees when they met last month in Paris. I was at that meeting and so was President Zelenskyy. Some European allies have announced that they will deploy troops to Ukraine after a deal is reached. Troops on the ground, jets in the air, ships on the Black Sea. The United States will be the backstop, others have vowed to support in other ways. The security guarantees are solid, and this is crucial – because we know that getting to an agreement to end this terrible war will require difficult choices. Share\n\n8h ago 12.27 GMT Zelenskyy says work of his negotiators 'will be adjusted' after Russia used 'record number' of ballistic missiles in latest attack Shifting our attention back to Ukraine now, where the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Russia’s latest attacks involved a “record number” of ballistic missiles and deliberately targeted energy infrastructure. Zelenskyy said there were 32 ballistic missiles, 28 cruise missiles, 11 missiles of “other types” and 450 attack drones used in the assualt that was launched as temperatures dropped to -20C and left many apartments in Kyiv without heating. In a post on X, Zelenskyy wrote: Energy infrastructure facilities in several regions were hit, with the greatest damage in the Kharkiv and Dnipro regions, Kyiv and the region, the Vinnytsia and Odesa regions, as well as in Zaporizhzhia… The heating situation is particularly difficult in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro, as well as Lozova in the Kharkiv region … Each such Russian strike confirms that attitudes in Moscow have not changed: they continue to bet on war and the destruction of Ukraine, and they do not take diplomacy seriously. The work of our negotiating team will be adjusted accordingly. The overnight Russian ballistic and drone attack came shortly before Nato chief Mark Rutte was in Kyiv to meet Zelenskyy and to address the national parliament. The latest round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US are due to be held on Wednesday and Thursday in Abu Dhabi. You can read more here.
